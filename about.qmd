In this blog, I intend to compose a post detailing each discovery that I have made through the regular utilization of R. 

I consider it to be mainly a daybook where I can easily find my solutions again. You may find some simple cases, but also more complex ones. 

Hopefully, you will also encounter something of value to yourself!

I wish you a pleasant reading!
