# Progress bars

Sometimes, you want to include a progress bar in your pipeline, to see how much code has been executed and how much is left.

Here are some possibilities to do that.

## The {purrr} package

```{r}
#| label: purrr_walk
#| message: false
#| warning: false

purrr::walk(1:3, Sys.sleep, .progress = TRUE)
```

## The {cli} package

You can also create a progress bar with the {cli} package. Please refer to [this article](https://cli.r-lib.org/articles/progress.html) which presents several possibilities to create a progress bar.
