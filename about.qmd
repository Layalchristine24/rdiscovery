In this blog, I intend to compose a post for each noteworthy discovery that I have made through the regular utilization of R.

I consider it to be mainly a daybook, where I can classify my solutions and links to related topics. You may find some simple cases, but also more complex ones. I will also report and demonstrate useful packages or repositories from other developers to whom I assign the copyright for the content of these particular posts.

Hopefully, you will also encounter something of value to yourself!

I wish you a pleasant reading!
