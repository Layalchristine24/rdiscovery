*What are the main differences between [openxlsx](https://github.com/awalker89/openxlsx) and [openxlsx2](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2)?*

### Introduction

Within this blog post, my aim is to elucidate the primary distinctions between [openxlsx](https://github.com/awalker89/openxlsx) and [openxlsx2](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2). I've encountered these variances through a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/JanMarvin/a0d89bb8e128899477654dd2d4f4402d), the informative vignette titled ["Update from openxlsx"](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/articles/Update-from-openxlsx.html), and my personal hands-on experience.

The provided tables are designed to offer a clear overview of the differences between openxlsx and openxlsx2. They serve as a concise presentation, illustrating the content of the vignette titled "Update from openxlsx," which can be explored in detail [here](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/articles/Update-from-openxlsx.html).

### Chaining vs Piping

In contrast to openxlsx, openxlsx2 enables the creation of workbooks, the addition of styles, data writing, and other operations through the use of chained or piped operations.

If you lean towards utilizing pipes, please turn to the last column in the tables within the subsequent sections. This column specifies the corresponding function and its recommended usage with pipes. If the function is the same in both columns, it can be used with pipes or chains.

Kindly explore [this specific vignette section](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/articles/Update-from-openxlsx.html#styles) for an example that contrasts openxlsx and openxlsx2. Unlike openxlsx, which lacks integration with pipes or chains, openxlsx2 offers flexibility in its application.

### Read an existing Excel Workbook

```{r}
#| label: table_read_wb
#| tbl-cap: "Create a workbook and write data"
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

library(knitr)

table_read_wb <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Action, ~openxlsx, ~`chain`, ~`pipe`,
  "Load file", "", "`wb_load()`", "`wb_load()`",
  "Read file", "", "`wb_to_df()`", "`wb_to_df()`",
  "Read file", "`read.xlsx()`", "`read_xlsx()`", "`read_xlsx()`",
  "Read file", "`readWorkbook()`", "`wb_read()`", "`wb_read()`"
)
```

Please note that while openxlsx2 can read `xlsx` or `xlsm` files, openxlsx can only read `xlsx` files.

```{r}
#| label: print_table_read_wb
#| tbl-cap: "Read an existing Excel workbook"
#| tbl-colwidths: [50,60,60,60]
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
kable(table_read_wb) |>
  kableExtra::add_header_above(c(" " = 1, " " = 1, "openxlsx2" = 2))
```

Please be aware that the recently introduced functions in openxlsx2, namely `read_xlsx()` and `wb_read()`, serve as mere wrappers for `wb_to_df()`. Their purpose is to facilitate a seamless transition between openxlsx and openxlsx2.

### Write a file (xlsx or xlsm)

```{r}
#| label: table_write_wb
#| tbl-cap: "Write an xlsx or xlsm workbook"
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

library(knitr)

table_write_wb <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Action, ~openxlsx, ~`chain`, ~`pipe`,
  "Create temporary xlsm file", "", "`temp_xlsx(macros = TRUE)`", "`temp_xlsx(macros = TRUE)`",
  "Create temporary xlsx file", "`temp_xlsx()`", "`temp_xlsx()`", "`temp_xlsx()`",
  "Write file", "`write.xlsx()`", "`write_xlsx()`", "`write_xlsx()`"
)
```


```{r}
#| label: print_table_write_wb
#| tbl-cap: "Write an xlsx or xlsm workbook"
#| tbl-colwidths: [50,60,60,60]
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
kable(table_write_wb) |>
  kableExtra::add_header_above(c(" " = 1, " " = 1, "openxlsx2" = 2))
```


### Create an Excel Workbook from Scratch

Let's say you would like to create a workbook called `wb` and a worksheet called `ws` where you want to write data `x`. 

```{r}
#| label: table_create_wb
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

library(knitr)

table_create_wb <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Action, ~openxlsx, ~`chain`, ~`pipe`,
  "Create workbook", "`createWorkbook()`", "`wb_workbook()`", "`wb_workbook()`",
  "Add worksheet ", "`addWorksheet(wb, ws)`", "`wb$add_worksheet(ws)`", "`wb_add_worksheet(ws)`",
  "Add data to worksheet", "`writeData(wb, ws, x)`", "`wb$add_data(x)`", "`wb_add_data(x)`",
  "Inspect workbook", "`openXL(wb)`", "`wb$open()`", "`wb_open()`"
)
```


```{r}
#| label: print_table_create_wb
#| tbl-cap: "Create a workbook and write data"
#| tbl-colwidths: [50,60,60,60]
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
kable(table_create_wb) |>
  kableExtra::add_header_above(c(" " = 1, " " = 1, "openxlsx2" = 2))
```

#### Example

```{r}
library(openxlsx2)
# With Pipes
wb <- wb_workbook(creator = "Layal Christine Lettry",
  title = "My Test",
  subject = "Create a Workbook",
  category = "Test",
  datetime_created = Sys.time(),
  theme = "Office Theme",
  keywords = "test",
  comments = "This is my test",
  manager = "Me",
  company = "My Company") 
  

```
