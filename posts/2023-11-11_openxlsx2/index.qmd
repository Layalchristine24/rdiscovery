*What are the main differences between [openxlsx](https://github.com/awalker89/openxlsx) and [openxlsx2](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2)?*

### Introduction

In this blog post, I intend to explain the main differences between [openxlsx](https://github.com/awalker89/openxlsx) and [openxlsx2](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2), which I came across thanks to this [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/JanMarvin/a0d89bb8e128899477654dd2d4f4402d) and my own experience.

See <https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/articles/Update-from-openxlsx.html>.

```{r}
#| label: diff_openxlsx
#| tbl-cap: "Table for differences between openxlsx and openxlsx2"
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

library(knitr)

table <- tibble::tribble(
  ~Action,          ~openxlsx,            ~openxlsx2,
  'Create a workbook', '`wb <- createWorkbook()`',  '`wb <- wb_workbook()`', 
  'Add a worksheet "ws1"', '`ws1 <- addWorksheet(wb = wb, sheetName = "ws1")`', '`wb$add_worksheet("ws1")`',
  'Add data to "ws1"', '`writeData(wb = wb, sheet = "ws1", x = cars, startCol = 2)`', 'w`b$add_data(x = cars, start_col = 2)`'
)
```


```{r}
#| label: print_diff_openxlsx
#| tbl-cap: "Differences between openxlsx and openxlsx2"
#| tbl-colwidths: [40,60,60]
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
kable(table)

```
