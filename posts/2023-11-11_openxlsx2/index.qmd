*What are the main differences between [openxlsx](https://github.com/awalker89/openxlsx) and [openxlsx2](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2)?*

# Introduction

Within this blog post, my aim is to elucidate the primary distinctions between [openxlsx](https://github.com/awalker89/openxlsx) and [openxlsx2](https://github.com/JanMarvin/openxlsx2). I've encountered these variances through a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/JanMarvin/a0d89bb8e128899477654dd2d4f4402d), the informative vignette titled ["Update from openxlsx"](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/articles/Update-from-openxlsx.html), and my personal hands-on experience.

The provided tables are designed to offer a clear overview of the differences between openxlsx and openxlsx2. They serve as a concise presentation, illustrating the content of the vignette titled "Update from openxlsx," which can be explored in detail [here](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/articles/Update-from-openxlsx.html).

# Chaining versus Piping

In contrast to openxlsx, openxlsx2 enables the creation of workbooks, the addition of styles, data writing, and other operations through the use of chained or piped operations. 

In their recent update on openxlsx2, Jordan Mark Barbone and Jan Marvin Garbuszus shared a significant development in this ["vignette section"](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/articles/Update-from-openxlsx.html?q=r6#why-openxlsx2): the transition to R6 in openxlsx2. This shift signifies a fundamental change in the relationship between `methods` and `objects` within openxlsx2, where `methods` are now associated with `objects` rather than `generics`. 

Therefore, functions can now be seamlessly chained. Moreover, operation pipelines can now be used in openxlsx2 as opposed to openxlsx. This change was triggered by the restructuration of the internal framework of openxlsx.

For those seeking a deeper understanding of R6, please refer to [Chapter 6 of "Advanced R" by Hadley Wickham](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html#r6). This chapter provides comprehensive insights into the principles and applications of R6.

In the tables below, we've highlighted the key arguments for each function. For a deeper dive into the specifics of each function's arguments, check out the examples in the following sections.

Kindly explore [this specific vignette section](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/articles/Update-from-openxlsx.html#styles) for an example that contrasts openxlsx and openxlsx2. Unlike openxlsx, which lacks integration with pipes or chains, openxlsx2 offers flexibility in its application.

In the forthcoming examples, I will employ pipes and chains to illustrate diverse applications of the openxlsx2 functions. Feel free to use your preferred method!


# Read an existing Excel Workbook

```{r}
#| label: table_read_wb
#| tbl-cap: "Create a workbook and write data"
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false
library(palmerpenguins)
library(openxlsx2)
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

table_read_wb <- tribble(
  ~Action, ~openxlsx, ~`chain`, ~`pipe`,
  "Load file", "", "`wb_load()`", "`wb_load()`",
  "Read file", "", "`wb_to_df()`", "`wb_to_df()`",
  "Read file", "`read.xlsx()`", "`read_xlsx()`", "`read_xlsx()`",
  "Read file", "`readWorkbook()`", "`wb_read()`", "`wb_read()`"
)
```

Please note that while openxlsx2 can read `xlsx` or `xlsm` files, openxlsx can only read `xlsx` files.

```{r}
#| label: print_table_read_wb
#| tbl-cap: "Read an existing Excel workbook"
#| tbl-colwidths: [50,60,60,60]
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
kable(table_read_wb) |>
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, " " = 1, "openxlsx2" = 2))
```

Please be aware that the recently introduced functions in openxlsx2, namely `read_xlsx()` and `wb_read()`, serve as mere wrappers for `wb_to_df()`. Their purpose is to facilitate a seamless transition between openxlsx and openxlsx2.

## Example

In this example, I want to illustrate how to read an Excel file efficiently. 

You can use `wb_to_df()`, `wb_read()` or `read_xlsx()` which almost have all arguments in common, since `wb_read()` and `read_xlsx()` are wrappers of `wb_to_df()`.

When you read an Excel file, you can define the types of the columns directly.
Please refer to the [Details section](https://janmarvin.github.io/openxlsx2/reference/wb_to_df.html#details) for more information. Please keep in mind that the `type` argument must be a named numeric where each variables belongs to one of these instances: 

- 0: character

- 1: numeric

- 2: date

- 3: posixt (datetime)

- 4: logical

```{r}
#| label: example_table_read_wb
#| message: false
#| warning: false
file <- system.file("extdata", "openxlsx2_example.xlsx", package = "openxlsx2")

# With wb_load
my_wb_loaded <- wb_load(file)
my_wb_loaded
wb_open(my_wb_loaded) # take a look at the raw xlsx file
my_df_loaded <- wb_to_df(my_wb_loaded,
  sheet = 1,
  skip_empty_cols = TRUE,
  skip_empty_rows = TRUE,
  show_formula = TRUE,
  na.strings = c("#NUM!", "#VALUE!"),
  types = c(
    "Var1" = 4, "Var2" = 1, "Var3" = 1, "Var4" = 0, "Var5" = 2,
    "Var6" = 0, "Var7" = 0, "Var8" = 3
  )
)
my_df_loaded

# With read_xlsx
my_xslx_read <- read_xlsx(file,
  convert = FALSE # to keep all variables as characters
)
glimpse(my_xslx_read)

# With wb_read
my_wb_read <- wb_read(file,
  detect_dates = TRUE
)
glimpse(my_wb_read)
```

Note that all returned objects have the class `data.frame`. 

```{r}
#| label: example_table_read_wb_class
#| message: false
#| warning: false
class(my_df_loaded)
class(my_xslx_read)
class(my_wb_read)
```

# Write a file (xlsx or xlsm)

```{r}
#| label: table_write_wb
#| tbl-cap: "Write an xlsx or xlsm workbook"
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

table_write_wb <- tribble(
  ~Action, ~openxlsx, ~`chain`, ~`pipe`,
  "Create temporary xlsm file", "", "`temp_xlsx(macros = TRUE)`", "`temp_xlsx(macros = TRUE)`",
  "Create temporary xlsx file", "`temp_xlsx()`", "`temp_xlsx()`", "`temp_xlsx()`",
  "Write file", "`write.xlsx()`", "`write_xlsx()`", "`write_xlsx()`"
)
```


```{r}
#| label: print_table_write_wb
#| tbl-cap: "Write an xlsx or xlsm workbook"
#| tbl-colwidths: [50,60,60,60]
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
kable(table_write_wb) |>
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, " " = 1, "openxlsx2" = 2))
```

## Example


Let's say we want to put the information about `palmerpenguins::penguins` in a new Excel file.

Then, we would like to include `palmerpenguins::penguins_raw` in the same Excel file. 


```{r}
#| label: example_table_write_wb
#| message: false
#| warning: false

my_tempfile <- temp_xlsx()
write_xlsx(penguins, my_tempfile, col_names = TRUE)
read_xlsx(my_tempfile) |>
  as_tibble()

my_2nd_tempfile <- temp_xlsx()
write_xlsx(
  list(
    "penguins" = penguins,
    "penguins_raw" = penguins_raw
  ),
  my_2nd_tempfile,
  start_col = c(1, 2),
  start_row = c(2, 3),
  col_names = TRUE
)
browseURL(my_2nd_tempfile) # open in Excel
read_xlsx(my_2nd_tempfile, sheet = "penguins") |>
  as_tibble()

browseURL(my_2nd_tempfile)
read_xlsx(my_2nd_tempfile, sheet = "penguins_raw") |>
  as_tibble()
```


# Create an Excel Workbook from Scratch

Let's say you would like to create a workbook called `wb` and a worksheet called `ws` where you want to write data `x`. 

```{r}
#| label: table_create_wb
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

table_create_wb <- tribble(
  ~Action, ~openxlsx, ~`chain`, ~`pipe`,
  "Create workbook", "`createWorkbook()`", "`wb_workbook()`", "`wb_workbook()`",
  "Add worksheet ", "`addWorksheet(wb, 'ws')`", "`wb$add_worksheet('ws')`", "`wb_add_worksheet('ws')`",
  "Add data to worksheet", "`writeData(wb, 'ws', x)`", "`wb$add_data(x)`", "`wb_add_data(x)`",
  "Inspect workbook", "`openXL(wb)`", "`wb$open()`", "`wb_open()`",
  "Save workbook", "`saveWorkbook(wb, file)", "`wb$save(file)`", "`wb_save(file)`"
)
```


```{r}
#| label: print_table_create_wb
#| tbl-cap: "Create a workbook and write data"
#| tbl-colwidths: [50,60,60,60]
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
kable(table_create_wb) |>
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, " " = 1, "openxlsx2" = 2))
```

## Example

In this example, our aim is to explore various options for creating, saving, and importing an Excel workbook.

### Create a workbook with multiple sheets

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

#### Chained

```{r}
#| label: chain_ex_table_create_wb_1
#| message: false
#| warning: false

wb <- wb_workbook(
  creator = "Layal Christine Lettry",
  title = "My Test",
  subject = "Create a Workbook",
  category = "Test",
  datetime_created = Sys.time(),
  theme = "Office Theme",
  keywords = "test",
  comments = "This is my test",
  manager = "Me",
  company = "My Company"
)$
  add_worksheet(
  sheet = "my_first_sheet",
  tab_color = "blue",
  zoom = 150L,
  visible = TRUE,
  orientation = "portrait",
  header = c("ODD HEAD LEFT", "ODD HEAD CENTER", "ODD HEAD RIGHT"),
  footer = c("ODD FOOT RIGHT", "ODD FOOT CENTER", "ODD FOOT RIGHT"),
  even_header = c("EVEN HEAD LEFT", "EVEN HEAD CENTER", "EVEN HEAD RIGHT"),
  even_footer = c("EVEN FOOT RIGHT", "EVEN FOOT CENTER", "EVEN FOOT RIGHT"),
  first_header = c("TOP", "OF FIRST", "PAGE"),
  first_footer = c("BOTTOM", "OF FIRST", "PAGE")
)$
  add_data(
  x = penguins,
  start_col = 3,
  start_row = 10,
  array = FALSE,
  col_names = TRUE,
  row_names = FALSE,
  with_filter = FALSE
)$
  add_worksheet(
  sheet = "my_second_sheet",
  tab_color = "red",
  zoom = 75L,
  visible = TRUE,
  orientation = "landscape"
)$
  add_data(
  x = penguins_raw,
  dims = wb_dims(2, 1),
  col_names = TRUE,
  row_names = TRUE,
  with_filter = TRUE
)
```

:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
<!-- empty column to create gap -->
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}


#### Piped

```{r}
#| label: pipe_ex_table_create_wb_1
#| message: false
#| warning: false

wb <- wb_workbook(
  creator = "Layal Christine Lettry",
  title = "My Test",
  subject = "Create a Workbook",
  category = "Test",
  datetime_created = Sys.time(),
  theme = "Office Theme",
  keywords = "test",
  comments = "This is my test",
  manager = "Me",
  company = "My Company"
) |>
  wb_add_worksheet(
    sheet = "my_first_sheet",
    tab_color = "blue",
    zoom = 150L,
    visible = TRUE,
    orientation = "portrait",
    header = c("ODD HEAD LEFT", "ODD HEAD CENTER", "ODD HEAD RIGHT"),
    footer = c("ODD FOOT RIGHT", "ODD FOOT CENTER", "ODD FOOT RIGHT"),
    even_header = c("EVEN HEAD LEFT", "EVEN HEAD CENTER", "EVEN HEAD RIGHT"),
    even_footer = c("EVEN FOOT RIGHT", "EVEN FOOT CENTER", "EVEN FOOT RIGHT"),
    first_header = c("TOP", "OF FIRST", "PAGE"),
    first_footer = c("BOTTOM", "OF FIRST", "PAGE")
  ) |>
  wb_add_data(
    x = penguins,
    start_col = 3,
    start_row = 10,
    array = FALSE,
    col_names = TRUE,
    row_names = FALSE,
    with_filter = FALSE
  ) |>
  wb_add_worksheet(
    sheet = "my_second_sheet",
    tab_color = "red",
    zoom = 75L,
    visible = TRUE,
    orientation = "landscape"
  ) |>
  wb_add_data(
    x = penguins_raw,
    dims = wb_dims(2, 1),
    col_names = TRUE,
    row_names = TRUE,
    with_filter = TRUE
  )
```

### Inspect and write the workbook data

You can perform the following steps to examine the data and save it to a temporary xlsx file.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

#### Chained

```{r}
#| label: chain_ex_table_create_wb_2
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Inspect the workbook
wb$open()

# Create a new temporary file
myfile <- temp_xlsx()

# Write the workbook into a temporary xlsx file
wb$save(file = myfile, overwrite = TRUE)

# Open the xlsx file
browseURL(myfile)
```

:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
<!-- empty column to create gap -->
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

#### Piped

```{r}
#| label: pipe_ex_table_create_wb_2
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Inspect the workbook
wb |>
  wb_open()

# Create a new temporary file
myfile <- temp_xlsx()

# Write the workbook into a temporary xlsx file
wb |>
  wb_save(file = myfile, overwrite = TRUE)

# Open the xlsx file
browseURL(myfile)
```

:::

::::

Please be aware that in order to view the headers and footers, you should click on "View" and select "Header and Footer" (for Mac users). This option enables you to distinguish between the landscape and portrait orientations on the two sheets.

### Import workbook and start working on the data with dplyr

Here, no operations are available for chaining.

```{r}
#| label: ex_table_create_wb_3
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Import the data of your file into a data frame
my_df <- myfile |>
  wb_to_df(
    sheet = 1,
    detect_dates = TRUE,
    col_names = TRUE
  )

# Display the first few rows of the data frame
my_df |>
  head()

# Provide a summary of the data frame structure
my_df |>
  glimpse()

# Provide the class of the data frame
class(my_df)

# Convert it into a tibble
my_tib <- as_tibble(my_df)
my_tib
```
