        "*How can you integrate Plausible Analytics into both your Hugo and Quarto websites?*\n",
        "\n",
        "### Introduction\n",
        "In this article, I will explain how to utilize [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) with a Hugo website featuring the [Hugo Apéro](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app) theme and with a Quarto website.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Motivation\n",
        "When I wanted to install [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision) for my personal Hugo and Quarto websites to gather usage statistics, I came across [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/731), which piqued my interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "According to [Seth Ariel Green](https://github.com/setgree), the author of [the GitHub issue](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/731), using [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision) was discouraged, and an alternative tool was recommended to track website traffic, namely [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io).\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, I sought information on how to install [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) to begin measuring site traffic metrics for my personal website built with [Hugo Apéro](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app). Unfortunately, I couldn't find a clear description of the installation process. This article aims to share my experience with you.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Choose Plausible Analytics Over Google Analytics?\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Background\n",
        "In 2022, some countries banned the use of [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision), citing it as unlawful and in violation of the [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/#:~:text=The%20General%20Data%20Protection%20Regulation,to%20people%20in%20the%20EU.). Countries such as [France](https://www.cnil.fr/en/use-google-analytics-and-data-transfers-united-states-cnil-orders-website-manageroperator-comply), [Italy](https://www.cpomagazine.com/data-protection/italy-bans-google-analytics-over-improper-eu-us-data-transfers/), [Austria](https://matomo.org/blog/2022/01/google-analytics-gdpr-violation/), and [Denmark](https://cookie-script.com/privacy-laws/danish-dpa-outlaws-using-google-analytics), among others, implemented these restrictions. Additional information is available on [this webpage](https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-illegal).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Advantages of Plausible Analytics\n",
        "Three key advantages of using Plausible Analytics over Google Analytics are as follows[^1]:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) is a lightweight and straightforward analytics tool that provides clear statistics on a single page. This contrasts with [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision), which requires exploration and understanding of its various options and dashboards.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The analytics script of [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) is smaller and lighter than that of [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision), resulting in no slowdown for your website.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) prioritizes visitor privacy and avoids the use of cookies.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more reasons to choose [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io), you can refer to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/) since it is open-source.\n",
        "\n",
        "[^1]: [My reference](https://plausible.io/simple-web-analytics).\n",

        "2. [Add your website details](https://plausible.io/docs/add-website).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### If you have a Hugo Website with the Hugo Apéro Theme\n",
        "\n",
        "3. [Add your JavaScript snippet to the `<head>` of your website](https://plausible.io/docs/plausible-script). If your website is built with [Hugo Apéro](https://hugo-apero-docs.netlify.app), follow these sub-steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "    i) Create a new file in `themes/hugo-apero/layouts/partials/head_custom.html`, similar to what's done in [this commit](https://github.com/Layalchristine24/Layalchristine24.github.io/commit/b223aef03f779a6708450815fa29015425498679)).\n",

        "\n",
        "6. If everything went as planned, you will receive an email beginning with \"Congrats! The Plausible script has been installed correctly on [your website].\"\n",
